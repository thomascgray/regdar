You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the W<span>arlock table.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spell Slots</h5>\r\n<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short <span>or long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <span>witch bolt</span>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd<span>-level spell.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warloc<span>k spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&rsquo;s shown in the table&rsquo;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, <span>or 3rd level.</span></p>\r\n<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have<span> spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<p><strong><span>Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\r\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wa<span>rlock spells.</span></p>",

        "publicNotes": "<p><strong>Exandria</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>The continent of Exandria sits as&nbsp;the greatest trade centre in the Eastern Hemisphere of the World known as Taerus (<em>Tearis</em>). Here we find Humans, Halflings, Orcs, Dwarves, Half Elves and various folk of mixed lineage. Though more exotic races can be encountered, there exists&nbsp;no significant settlement of the scaled Dragon kin, nor Tiefling devils or the many creatures of myth and legend that outsiders tell of in stories by the fireside after many a glass of grog.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Empire</strong></p>\r\n<p>The land to the West is home to the Human Kingdom of Emperor Ursus Taldir. The Taldiri Empire is a shining example of coexistence between races, many of whom were drawn to this land by the Capital Port City of Heraldholm and the vast swathes of agricultural land to the North and West. In recent years the old feudal society has subsided and, though a few Noble families still cling to what little power they still retain, an age of freedom and opportunity rises on the horizon. A tenuous alliance with the Dwarven Clans has held for centuries, but fractures are showing as a nameless threat in the North raises tension among the civilised folk of Exandria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Dwarven Clans</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nestled within the towering peaks of the \"Spine of the World\" mountains, the two Great Dwarven Halls of Iron Crest and Kazak Duir have long held the&nbsp;Eastern Orc Horde at bay, facilitating an age of prosperity in the&nbsp;Empire lands to the West. The treacherous mountain passes can be held by a small force of warriors, whilst the roads to the South travel too close to the mysterious Forests of Mist, meaning the only significant fortifications span the Northern pass known as the the Throat. Recent times have seen many Dwarven outposts in the North mysteriously destroyed, and despite calling upon the Treaties of Union, Emperor Taldir has not provided forces to bolster the pass. The alliance wears thin, and tempers run high in the Clan Counsils under the mountain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Jagged Wargh</strong></p>\r\n<p>Under the iron grip of the Goliath Warlord Kragnut Gashk, the Orc Hordes in the East have often crossed swords with Clans in the mountains, but it is long since the great Wargh marched in force to find battle. Though savage and hard, the Horde dare not travel far to the South for fear of finding themselves lost among the shifting&nbsp;boughs of the dark forest and instead settle in the Northern hills and woods, biding their time. Yet a terrifying and unknown force now drives the Horde to action, Kragnut loses much of his control in the face of this new alien threat and those of meeker resolve flee, seeking to save their own hides.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Adventurers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Having spent much of their lives in the safe lands&nbsp;of Western Exandria, their knowledge of the outside world is limited save for the stories and fables told by the older folk and foreign travellers. Each with their own troubles, goals and aspirations our Adventurers go about their business, unaware of the great&nbsp;tapestry about to be woven of great heroism or of great evil.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Opening</strong></p>\r\n<p>You are in the town of Flaxen, atop the golden fields North of Heraldholm, tucked into the feet of the Crow Cap Mountains. A humble but bustling town, a melting pot of farmers from the South, Miners from the hills to the North, and the hub of the lumber trade in the Empire, many come here to make some coin, or to spend time at the Lyceum, a school for those with ambitions of knowledge but lacking the gold (or status) to attend the great Universities of Westmount. Why are you here? Is this home or just a stop on your journey? Regardless, it's late so go and grab a beer at the local watering hole, you never know what adventures might occur!</p>",
